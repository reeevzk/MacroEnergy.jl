## PJM Load Forecasting Extension for MacroEnergy

This extension adds a data-driven electricity demand forecasting pipeline to the MacroEnergy optimization framework, focusing on PJM grid data.
It relies on LSTM forecasting through the Flux.jl module and integrates into the MILP workflow of the rest of the package.

# Features

- **Data Cleaning & Aggregation**  
  Cleans raw PJM hourly load data and maps zones to three zones compatible with the larger scale Macro files.

- **LSTM Forecasting (Flux.jl)**  
  Trains a zone-wise LSTM model on historical load to predict future demand.  

- **Scenario Generation**  
  Produces multiple demand scenarios (optimistic, central, conservative) for stochastic MILP analysis.  

- **MacroEnergy Integration**  
  Exports `demand.csv` in the exact format required by MacroEnergy, with minimal changes to core files.  

# Next Update:
Working on a mapping system that generalizes to more zones beyond PJM that creates zones that contextualize based on each state’s demands.

## Usage

1. Place the raw PJM CSV in `data/raw_pjm_load.csv`.  
2. Run the pipeline:

julia run_pjm_pipeline.jl
